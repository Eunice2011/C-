damn
who knew
all the planes we flew
good things we been through
that i'd be standing right here talking to you about
another path i know we loved to hit the road and laugh
but something told me that it wouldn't last
had to switch up
look at things different see the bigger picture
those were the days hard work forever pays
now i see you in a better place.

how could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
everything i went through you were standing there by my side
and now you be with gonna me for the last ride.

first you both go out your way
and the vibe is feeling strong
and what's small turn to a friendship
turned into a bond and that bond will
never be broke and the love will
never get lost.

and when brotherhood come
first then the line will never be crossed
established it on our own
when that line had to be drawn
and that line is
what we reached so remember me when i'm gone.

light guide your way.
hold every memory as you go
and every road you take
o will always lead you home.
